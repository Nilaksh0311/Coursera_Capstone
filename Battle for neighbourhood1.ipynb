It is one of the major hubs \nof the world and is extremely diverse with people from various ethnicities \nresiding here. The multi-cultural nature of the city of Mumbai has brought along \nwith it numerous cuisines from all over the world. The people of India generally \nlove food and I personally love to try different cuisines and experience different \nflavors. Thus, the aim of this project is to study the neighborhoods in Mumbai to \ndetermine possible locations for starting a restaurant. This project can be useful \nfor business owners and entrepreneurs who are looking to invest and open a \nrestaurant in Mumbai. The main objective of this project is to carefully analyze \nappropriate data and find recommendations for the stakeholders"
